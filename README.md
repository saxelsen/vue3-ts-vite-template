# Vue3 + Typescript app using Vite builder

## Getting started

Requirements:
- `node>=16`
- `yarn` or `npm`

I've used `yarn`, but it works just as well with `npm`.

1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
2. Run the app in development mode: `yarn dev`
3. Navigate to your browser at `localhost:8080`
